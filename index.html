    <h2>Dogs</h2>
    <p>Dogs are known for their loyalty, affection, and obedience. They are social animals that thrive on human interaction and are excellent at forming strong bonds with their owners. Dogs are also highly intelligent and can be trained to perform a variety of tasks, such as playing fetch, performing tricks, and even assisting people with disabilities.</p>

    <h2>Cats</h2>
    <p>Cats are independent creatures that are often content to spend time alone. They are known for their playful nature and love for games and toys. Despite their reputation for being aloof, many cats form strong bonds with their owners and enjoy spending time cuddled up on laps or in cozy beds. Cats are also known for their grooming habits and fastidiousness when it comes to keeping themselves clean.</p>

    <h2>Exercise and Playtime</h2>
    <p>Dogs require a lot of physical activity and mental stimulation to stay happy and healthy. They love going for walks, playing fetch, and running around in the backyard. Without regular exercise, dogs can become destructive or develop behavior problems.</p>
    <p>Cats, on the other hand, are more low-maintenance when it comes to exercise. They do enjoy playing with toys and stalking prey, but they are also content to nap for hours on end. This makes cats a good choice for people who have busy schedules or limited space for a pet.</p>

    <p>Cats are easier to care for in terms of feeding and grooming. They are known for their fastidious grooming habits and can keep themselves clean with regular grooming.
